**Project Title:** AI-Powered PMP Documentation Assistant

**Overview:**
The AI-Powered PMP Documentation Assistant is a smart assistant platform designed to help project managers generate comprehensive, structured project documentation effortlessly. The platform allows users to input basic project details and, using AI, produces standard PMP documents such as Project Charters, Scope Statements, Risk Registers, and more. The frontend collects user inputs, and the AI backend intelligently transforms those inputs into formal documents using prompt engineering, templates, and LLMs.

**Key Features:**

* **Smart Document Generation:** Generates complete PMP documents (Charter, Scope, WBS, etc.) from basic inputs.
* **Interactive Flow:** 3-step form to collect necessary data with real-time validations.
* **Editable Outputs:** Users can edit, download, or regenerate documents.
* **Dynamic Templates:** Uses project type to influence tone and structure of documents.
* **Project Memory:** Recalls previous project info for context-aware edits or add-ons.

---

**AI Backend Responsibilities:**

1. **Prompt Engineering:**

   * Custom prompts per PMP document.
   * Input transformation (raw user data ‚ûù structured prompt).

2. **Template Insertion:**

   * Populate templates using generated LLM output.
   * Format to .docx or PDF for downloads.

3. **API Design:**

   * POST /generate-document
   * GET /project/{id}/documents
   * PATCH /document/{id}/edit

4. **Memory/Context Management (Optional):**

   * Embedding user input for each project.
   * Retrieve context for follow-up questions or improvements.

**Suggested Tech Stack:**

* **Backend Framework:** FastAPI or Flask
* **LLM Integration:** OpenAI (GPT-4), Claude, or Groq (Mixtral)
* **Chaining & Prompt Management:** LangChain
* **Document Formatting:** `python-docx`, `pdfkit`, or `docxtpl`
* **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL or Supabase
* **File Storage:** AWS S3, Firebase, or Supabase Storage
* **Authentication (Optional):** Firebase Auth or Auth0
* **Embedding & Retrieval (Optional):** FAISS, Weaviate, or Chroma
* **Frontend Framework (for integration):** React or Next.js

**What Will Make It Stand Out:**

* **Explainable AI Summaries:** Each document can include a sidebar explaining why specific content was generated.
* **Voice Input & Output Support:** Let users speak their inputs and receive a narrated version of the docs.
* **Multilingual Support:** Allow project managers to generate documents in multiple languages.
* **Versioning:** Keep track of document edits and allow restoring older versions.
* **Collaboration Tools:** Allow multiple team members to review or co-edit project docs.
* **Risk AI:** Real-time risk suggestion engine that flags missing risks based on industry data.

---

**Next Steps:**

* Design prompt templates for each document type.
* Set up backend with FastAPI and LangChain.
* Connect to frontend form steps.
* Integrate docx generation using `python-docx` or similar.
* (Optional) Add embeddings for memory + context.
